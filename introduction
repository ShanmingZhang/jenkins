* Open source automation server
  To build an test software projects continously
  Using jenkens, can accelerate software development
  Achieves CI with help of plugins
  Setup jenkins to watch for any code change



* Benefits
  Open source tool
  Easy to install
  Has 1000+ plugins
  Free of cos
  Build with java
 
* Continuous Integration
  Jenkins is a CI tool, so what is CI
  Allows the teams to detect problems early
 
* Jenkins case study - nokia
  At nokia, in a software development project, there was a process called nightly builds
  Every night, an automated system pulls the code to shared repository
  Locating and fixing bugs is a real pain
  Nokia adopted CI (continuous integration)
 

* Jenkins's architecture
  Master -> Slave(s)
  
  Why distributed architecture for Jenkins?
   sometimes, several different environments needed
   if a larger project gets built, a single server cannot handle entire load
  
  Jenkins master:
   Scheduling jobs
   Communicating with the slaves
   Monitor the slaves
   Present the results
   Master can also execute build jobs
   TCP/IP
  Jenkins Slave
   Comunication with Jenkins master
   Can run in different OS
   Execute jobs
   Flexibility
   
   
  GitHub:
   Github repository -> [Jenkins master -> Jenkins slave]
